Different legend (if we want):

	Benedikt tried to implement this. Doesn't show in plot (out of range??), but no error message

Groupby, rollup (aggregation functions):

Scaling of y axis:
	Benedikt fixed this by rescaling the data to the respective max value (file SFBay_processed_scaled.csv) - let me know what you think. The extra 30% on top would be reserved for the legend
